I use lots of references and highly incentive you to look for other too and propose changes in this repo. Sometimes, it will mostly presented in a chaotic way, which implies that you will need to explore the concepts by yourself or read the manual/books. Every student should follow your own path to learning, it is impossible to cover every learning style, so it is up to you to build your own path and discover the best way to learn. What worked for me or what works for a given student probably won't work for you, so dont compare yourself to others too much, but be assured that we're here to help you to succeed.

It will add 3 padding bytes between the <code>int</code> and the last <code>char</code> to align the data with biggest field in the struct. In this case, the total memory usage of the struct will be 12 bytes instead of the expected 8.</p> <pre><code>struct InneficientMemoryLayoutExample\n{\nchar a; // 1 byte\n// compiler will add 3 padding bytes here\nint b; // 4 bytes\nchar c; // 1 byte\nchar d; // 1 bytes\nchar e; // 1 byte\n// compiler will add 1 padding byte here\n}; // total of 12 bytes allocated for this layout\n</code></pre> <p>You might think C++ compilers are smart and reorder the fields for us, but in order to maintain compatibility to C, the standard forbids it. So if you want to pack more data you will have to reorder the layout manually to something like this:</p> <pre><code>struct EfficientMemoryLayoutExample\n{\nint b; // 4 bytes\nchar a; // 1 byte\nchar c; // 1 byte\nchar d; // 1 bytes\nchar e; // 1 byte\n}; // total of 8 bytes allocated for this layout\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively you can use the <code>#pragma pack</code> directive to tell the compiler to pack the data in memory without padding bytes. But be aware that it will force the compiler to do more memory operations to get the data, thus it will slow your software. Besides that, <code>pragma pack</code> may not work in all compilers. </p> <pre><code>#pragma pack(push, 1) // push current alignment to stack and set alignment to 1 byte boundary\nstruct EfficientMemoryLayoutExample\n{\nchar a; // 1 byte\nint b; // 4 bytes\nchar c; // 1 byte\nchar d; // 1 bytes\nchar e; // 1 byte\n};\n#pragma pack(pop)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"advanced/01-introduction/#bitfields","title":"Bitfields","text":"<p>If you really want to specify the layout location for each field and want to be sure that in will work on every compiler/platform, you will have to specify the number of bits each field will be able to use.

It can be real hard, so if we cover that, we are just goint to understand the overall idea, and learn how to use pre-determined models available for free. - Behavior trees - I have to be honest - ChatGPT and its siblings to generate text - I can cover at least how to modify small scoped model and use for your own intent. - Stable Diffusion and its siblings to generate images - I can cover at least how to modify small scoped model and use for your own intent. - AI subsystems and how to debug it. - Spatial quantization optimized for AI queries - I really enjoy this, but it can be hard to understand, because it uses lots of data structures</p> <p>Note for myself: game worldbox</p>"},{"location":"artificialintelligence/01-pcg/","title":"Procedural Content Generation","text":"<p>One of the more emergent fields in AI for games is Procedural Content Generation - PCG.

That would be good enough for most cases.</p>"},{"location":"cpm_modules/doctest/bcdb6a7e830053e9c0f36212e2a34ef2a4b8fb09/","title":"Index","text":"<p>              master branch                       dev branch          <p></p> <p>doctest is a new C++ testing framework but is by far the fastest both in compile times (by orders of magnitude) and runtime compared to other feature-rich alternatives. It brings the ability of compiled languages such as D / Rust / Nim to have tests written directly in the production code thanks to a fast, transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>The framework is and will stay free but needs your support to sustain its development. There are lots of new features and maintenance to do. If you work for a company using doctest or have the means to do so, please consider financial support. Monthly donations via Patreon and one-offs via PayPal.</p> <p></p> <p>A complete example with a self-registering test that compiles to an executable looks like this:</p> <p></p> <p>There are many C++ testing frameworks - Catch, Boost.Test, UnitTest++, cpputest, googletest and others.</p> <p>The key differences between it and other testing frameworks are that it is light and unintrusive: - Ultra light on compile times both in terms of including the header and writing thousands of asserts - Doesn't produce any warnings even on the most aggressive warning levels for MSVC/GCC/Clang - Can remove everything testing-related from the binary with the <code>DOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE</code> identifier - thread-safe - asserts can be used from multiple threads spawned from a single test case - example - asserts can be used outside of a testing context - as a general purpose assert library - example - No global namespace pollution (everything is in <code>doctest::</code>) &amp; doesn't drag any headers with it - Portable C++11 (use tag 1.2.9 for C++98) with over 100 different CI builds (static analysis, sanitizers..) - binaries (exe/dll) can use the test runner of another binary =&gt; tests in a single registry - example</p> <p></p> <p>This allows the framework to be used in more ways than any other - tests can be written directly in the production code!</p> <p>Tests can be a form of documentation and should be able to reside near the production code which they test.</p> <ul> <li>This makes the barrier for writing tests much lower - you don't have to: 1) make a separate source file 2) include a bunch of stuff in it 3) add it to the build system and 4) add it to source control - You can just write the tests for a class or a piece of functionality at the bottom of its source file - or even header file!</li> <li>Tests in the production code can be thought of as documentation/up-to-date comments - showcasing the APIs</li> <li>Testing internals that are not exposed through the public API and headers is no longer a mind-bending exercise</li> <li>Test-driven development in C++ has never been easier!</li> </ul> <p>The framework can be used just like any other without mixing production code and tests - check out the features.</p> <p>doctest is modeled after Catch and some parts of the code have been taken directly - check out the differences.</p> <p>This table compares doctest / Catch / lest which are all very similar.</p> <p>Checkout the CppCon 2017 talk on YouTube to get a better understanding of how the framework works and read about how to use it in the JetBrains article - highlighting the unique aspects of the framework! On a short description on how to use the framework along production code you could refer to this GitHub issue. There is also an older article in the february edition of ACCU Overload 2017.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"cpm_modules/doctest/bcdb6a7e830053e9c0f36212e2a34ef2a4b8fb09/#documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"<p>Project:</p> <ul> <li>Features and design goals - the complete list of features</li> <li>Roadmap - upcoming features</li> <li>Benchmarks - compile-time and runtime supremacy</li> <li>Contributing - how to make a proper pull request</li> <li>Changelog - generated changelog based on closed issues/PRs</li> </ul> <p>Usage:</p> <ul> <li>Tutorial - make sure you have read it before the other parts of the documentation</li> <li>Assertion macros</li> <li>Test cases, subcases and test fixtures</li> <li>Parameterized test cases</li> <li>Command line</li> <li>Logging macros</li> <li><code>main()</code> entry point</li> <li>Configuration</li> <li>String conversions</li> <li>Reporters</li> <li>Extensions</li> <li>FAQ</li> <li>Build systems</li> <li>Examples</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cpm_modules/doctest/bcdb6a7e830053e9c0f36212e2a34ef2a4b8fb09/#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Support the development of the project with donations!

Or, you may have defined several types that are supposed to conform to the same \"concept\" and you want to verify it. In both cases, you want the same test logic repeated for different types.</p> <p>While you can write one <code>TEST_CASE</code> for each type you want to test (and you may even factor the test logic into a function template that you invoke from the test case), it's tedious and doesn't scale: if you want <code>M</code> tests over <code>N</code> types, you'll end up writing <code>M * N</code> tests.</p> <p>Templated tests allow you to repeat the same test logic over a list of types. You only need to write the test logic once.</p> <p>There are 2 ways to do it:</p> <ul> <li> <p>directly pass the list of types to the templated test case</p> <pre><code>TEST_CASE_TEMPLATE(\"signed integers stuff\", T, char, short, int, long long int) {\nT var = T();\n--var;\nCHECK(var == -1);\n}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>define the templated test case with a specific unique name (identifier) for later instantiation</p> <p><pre><code>TEST_CASE_TEMPLATE_DEFINE(\"signed integer stuff\", T, test_id) {\nT var = T();\n--var;\nCHECK(var == -1);\n}\nTEST_CASE_TEMPLATE_INVOKE(test_id, char, short, int, long long int);\nTEST_CASE_TEMPLATE_APPLY(test_id, std::tuple&lt;float, double&gt;);\n</code></pre> If you are designing an interface or concept, you can define a suite of type-parameterized tests to verify properties that any valid implementation of the interface/concept should have. Then, the author of each implementation can just instantiate the test suite with their type to verify that it conforms to the requirements, without having to write similar tests repeatedly.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A test case named <code>signed integers stuff</code> instantiated for type <code>int</code> will yield the following test case name:</p> <pre><code>signed integers stuff&lt;int&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>By default all primitive types (fundamental - <code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>float</code>...) have stringification provided by the library. For all other types the user will have to use the <code>TYPE_TO_STRING(type)</code> macro - like this:</p> <pre><code>TYPE_TO_STRING(std::vector&lt;int&gt;);\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>TYPE_TO_STRING</code> macro has an effect only in the current source file and thus needs to be used in some header if the same type will be used in separate source files for templated test cases.</p> <p>Other testing frameworks use the header <code>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</code> in addition to demangling to get the string for types automatically but doctest cannot afford to include any header in it's forward declaration part (the public one) of the header - so the user has to teach the framework for each type.

You can only use that <code>#define</code> in one source file for (hopefully) obvious reasons. Once you have more than one file with unit tests in you'll just <code>#include \"doctest.h\"</code> and go. Usually it's a good idea to have a dedicated implementation file that just has <code>#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN</code> and <code>#include \"doctest.h\"</code>. You can also provide your own implementation of main and drive doctest yourself - see supplying your own <code>main()</code>.</li> <li>We introduce test cases with the <code>TEST_CASE</code> macro. It takes one argument - a free form test name (for more see Test cases and subcases). The test name doesn't have to be unique. You can run sets of tests by specifying a wildcarded test name or a tag expression. See the command line docs for more information on running tests.</li> <li>The name is just a string. We haven't had to declare a function or method - or explicitly register the test case anywhere. Behind the scenes a function with a generated name is defined for you and automatically registered using static registry classes. By abstracting the function name away we can name our tests without the constraints of identifier names.</li> <li>We write our individual test assertions using the <code>CHECK()</code> macro. Rather than a separate macro for each type of condition (equal, less than, greater than, etc.) we express the condition naturally using C++ syntax. Behind the scenes a simple expression template captures the left-hand-side and right-hand-side of the expression so we can display the values in our test report. There are other assertion macros not covered in this tutorial - but because of this technique the number of them is drastically reduced.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"cpm_modules/doctest/bcdb6a7e830053e9c0f36212e2a34ef2a4b8fb09/doc/markdown/tutorial/#test-cases-and-subcases","title":"Test cases and subcases","text":"<p>Most test frameworks have a class-based fixture mechanism - test cases map to methods on a class and common setup and teardown can be performed in <code>setup()</code> and <code>teardown()</code> methods (or constructor/ destructor in languages like C++ that support deterministic destruction).</p> <p>While doctest fully supports this way of working there are a few problems with the approach. In particular the way your code must be split up and the blunt granularity of it may cause problems. You can only have one setup/ teardown pair across a set of methods but sometimes you want slightly different setup in each method or you may even want several levels of setup (a concept which we will clarify later on in this tutorial). It was problems like these that led James Newkirk who led the team that built NUnit to start again from scratch and build xUnit).</p> <p>doctest takes a different approach (to both NUnit and xUnit) that is a more natural fit for C++ and the C family of languages.</p> <p>This is best explained through an example:</p> <pre><code>TEST_CASE(\"vectors can be sized and resized\") {\nstd::vector&lt;int&gt; v(5);\nREQUIRE(v.size() == 5);\nREQUIRE(v.capacity() &gt;= 5);\nSUBCASE(\"adding to the vector increases it's size\") {\nv.push_back(1);\nCHECK(v.size() == 6);\nCHECK(v.capacity() &gt;= 6);\n}\nSUBCASE(\"reserving increases just the capacity\") {\nv.reserve(6);\nCHECK(v.size() == 5);\nCHECK(v.capacity() &gt;= 6);\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For each <code>SUBCASE()</code> the <code>TEST_CASE()</code> is executed from the start - so as we enter each subcase we know that the size is 5 and the capacity is at least 5. We enforce those requirements with the <code>REQUIRE()</code> macros at the top level so we can be confident in them. If a <code>CHECK()</code> fails - the test is marked as failed but the execution continues - but if a <code>REQUIRE()</code> fails - execution of the test stops.</p> <p>This works because the <code>SUBCASE()</code> macro contains an if statement that calls back into doctest to see if the subcase should be executed. One leaf subcase is executed on each run through a <code>TEST_CASE()</code>. The other subcases are skipped. Next time the next subcase is executed and so on until no new subcases are encountered.</p> <p>So far so good - this is already an improvement on the setup/teardown approach because now we see our setup code inline and use the stack. The power of subcases really shows when we start nesting them like in the example below:</p>  Code  Output  <pre>\n#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN\n#include \"doctest.h\"\n\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nTEST_CASE(\"lots of nested subcases\") {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; \"root\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cout &lt;&lt; \"1\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") { cout &lt;&lt; \"1.1\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") {   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cout &lt;&lt; \"2\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") { cout &lt;&lt; \"2.1\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cout &lt;&lt; \"2.2\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cout &lt;&lt; \"2.2.1\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") { cout &lt;&lt; \"2.2.1.1\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") { cout &lt;&lt; \"2.2.1.2\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") { cout &lt;&lt; \"2.3\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBCASE(\"\") { cout &lt;&lt; \"2.4\" &lt;&lt; endl; }\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n}\n</pre> <pre>\nroot\n1\n1.1\nroot\n2\n2.1\nroot\n2\n2.2\n2.2.1\n2.2.1.1\nroot\n2\n2.2\n2.2.1\n2.2.1.2\nroot\n2\n2.3\nroot\n2\n2.4\n</pre> <p>Subcases can be nested to an arbitrary depth (limited only by your stack size).

A fatal failure in a parent subcase will prevent nested subcases from running - but then that's the idea.</p> <p>Keep in mind that even though doctest is thread-safe - using subcases has to be done only in the main test runner thread and all threads spawned in a subcase ought to be joined before the end of that subcase and no new subcases should be entered while other threads with doctest assertions in them are still running.</p>"},{"location":"cpm_modules/doctest/bcdb6a7e830053e9c0f36212e2a34ef2a4b8fb09/doc/markdown/tutorial/#scaling-up","title":"Scaling up","text":"<p>To keep the tutorial simple we put all our code in a single file.

C++ is one of the closest intelligible programming languages before reaching the level of  machine code, as known as Assembly Language. If you code in machine code, you obviously will code precisely what  you want the machine to do, but this task is too painful to be the de-facto standard of coding. So we need  something more straightforward and more human-readable. So C++ lies in this exact area of being close to assembly language and still able to be \"easily\" understandable. Note the quotes, they are there because it might not be that easy when you compare its syntax to other languages, C++ has to obey some constraints to keep the generated binary fast  as a mad horse while trying to be easier than assembly. Remember, it can always get worse.</p> <p></p> <p>The main philosophy that guides C++ is the \"Zero-cost abstractions\", and it is the main reason why C++ is so fast. It means that the language does not add any overhead to assembly. So, if someone proposes a new core feature as a Technical specification, it should pass through this filter. And it is a very high bar to pass. I am looking at you, ts reflection, everyone I know that want to make games, ask for this feature, but it is not there yet. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"intro/01-introduction/#why-does-speed-matter","title":"Why does speed matter?","text":"<p>Mainly because we don\u2019t want to waste time.

So, if you are a lazy  mobile developer and do not want to learn how to do code efficiently, you will make your app drain more energy  from the battery just by making the user wait for the task to be finished or by doing lots of unnecessary  calculations! You will be the reason the user has not enough power to use their phones up to the end of the day.  In fact, you will be punishing your user by using your app. You don\u2019t want that, right? So let\u2019s learn how to code  appropriately. For the sake of the argument, worse than that, a lazy blockchain smart contract developer will make  their users pay more for extra gas fee usage for the extra inefficient CPU cycles.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"intro/01-introduction/#language-benchmarks","title":"Language benchmarks","text":"<p>I don\u2019t want to point fingers at languages, but, hey, excuse me, python, are you listening to me, python?

Hey ruby, don\u2019t be shy, I know you look  gorgeous, and I  admire you a lot, but can you dress up faster and be ready to run anytime soon? </p> <p>You don\u2019t need makeup to run fast. That\u2019s the idea. If the language does lots of fancy stuff, it won\u2019t be extracting the juicy power of the CPU.</p> <p>So let\u2019s first clarify some concepts for a fair comparison. Some languages do not generate binaries that run in your  CPU. Some of them run on top of a virtual machine. The Virtual Machine(VM) is a piece of software that, in runtime,  translates the bytecode or even compiles source code to something the CPU can understand. It\u2019s like an old car;  some of them will make you wait for the ignition or even get warm enough to run fast. I am looking at you Java and JavaScript. It is a funny concept, I admit, but you can see here that the ones that run on top of a translation device  would never run as fast as a compiled binary ready to run on the CPU.</p> <p>So let\u2019s bring some ideas from my own experience, and I invite you to test by yourself. Just search for \"programming  languages benchmark\" on your preferred search engine or go here. </p> <p></p> <p>I don\u2019t want to start a flame-war. Those numbers might be wrong, but the overall idea is correct. Assuming C++ does not  add much overhead to your native binary, let\u2019s set the speed to run as 1x. Java would be around 1.4x slower, and  JavaScript is 1.6x, python 40x, and ruby 100x. The only good competitor in the house is Rust because its compiled code  runs straight on the CPU efficiently with lots of quality-of-life additions. Rust gives almost similar results if  you do not play around with memory-intensive problems. Another honorable mention is WASM - Web Assembly, although it is  a bytecode for a virtual machine, many programming languages are able to target it(compile for it), it is becoming blazing fast and it is getting traction nowadays, keep tuned. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"intro/01-introduction/#who-should-learn-c","title":"Who should learn C++","text":"<p>YOU!

There are many strategies and many ways of doing it. So, given its nature of being near assembly, with C++, you will control precisely what instructions the CPU will  run.</p> <p>But, there is a catch here: for each CPU, you will need a compiler for that instruction set. Ex.: the compiler GCC can generate an executable program for ARM processors, and the generated program won\u2019t work on x86 processors; In the same  way, an x64 executable won\u2019t work on an x86; you need to match the binary instructions generated by the compiler with  the same instruction set available on the target CPU you want to run it.

A compiler error message: When you try to compile your code, the compiler will often provide an error message  that can help you locate the source of the syntax error. These error messages can be somewhat cryptic, but they usually include the line number and a brief description of the problem. 2. A text editor with syntax highlighting: Many text editors, such as Visual Studio or Eclipse, include syntax highlighting, which can help you identify syntax errors by coloring different parts of the code differently. For example, keywords may be highlighted in blue, while variables may be highlighted in green. 3. A debugger: A debugger is a tool that allows you to step through your code line by line, examining the values of variables and the state of the program at each step.

To help address that, C++ introduced smart pointers. The general purpose smart contract you will be mostly using is <code>shared_ptr</code> that in the end of the scope and when all references to it become 0 will automatically free the memory. The other smart pointers are <code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>weak_ptr</code> that are used in more advanced scenarios. But for now, we will focus on <code>shared_ptr</code>.</p> <p>In C++11, smart pointers were introduced to help manage memory allocation and deallocation. Smart pointers are classes that wrap a pointer to a dynamically allocated object and provide additional features such as automatic memory management. The most commonly used smart pointers are <code>std::unique_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. The <code>std::unique_ptr</code> class is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes of that object when the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope. The <code>std::shared_ptr</code> class is a smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an object through a pointer. Several <code>std::shared_ptr</code> objects may own the same object. The object is destroyed and its memory deallocated when either of the following happens:</p> <ul> <li>the last remaining <code>std::shared_ptr</code> owning the object is:<ul> <li>destroyed</li> <li>is assigned another pointer via <code>operator=</code> or <code>reset()</code> </li> <li>is reset or released </li> <li>moved from</li> <li>is swapped with another <code>std::shared_ptr</code> using <code>swap()</code></li> <li>the function <code>std::shared_ptr::swap()</code> is called with the last remaining <code>std::shared_ptr</code> owning the object as an argument</li> </ul> </li> <li>the object is no longer reachable from the program (for example, when the program terminates)</li> <li>the program:<ul> <li>throws an exception that is not caught within the same thread</li> <li>calls terminating calls such as <code>std::terminate()</code>, <code>std::abort()</code>, <code>std::exit()</code>, or <code>std::quick_exit()</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To create a dynamic array of int using shared pointers, you can use the std::shared_ptr class template. Here's an example:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;memory&gt; // for std::shared_ptr\nstd::shared_ptr&lt;int[]&gt; arr(new int[5]);\n</code></pre> <p>This creates a shared pointer to an array of 5 integers. The <code>new int[5]</code> expression dynamically allocates memory for the array on the heap, and the shared pointer takes ownership of the memory. When the shared pointer goes out of scope, the memory is automatically freed.</p> <p>You can access individual elements of the array using the array subscript notation, just like with a regular C-style array:</p> <pre><code>arr[0] = 10;\narr[1] = 20;\narr[2] = 30;\narr[3] = 40;\narr[4] = 50;\n</code></pre> <p>To deallocate the memory, you don't need to call delete[] explicitly, because the shared pointer takes care of it automatically. When the last shared pointer that points to the array goes out of scope or is explicitly reset, the memory is deallocated automatically:</p> <pre><code>arr.reset(); // deallocates the memory and reset the shared pointer to null to avoid dangling pointers and other bugs\n</code></pre> <p>Shared pointers provide a convenient and safe way to manage dynamic memory in C++, because they automatically handle memory allocation and deallocation, and help prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.</p> <p>Smart pointers are no silver bullet. They are not a replacement for proper memory management, but they can help you avoid common memory management bugs and vulnerabilities. For example, smart pointers can help you avoid memory leaks, dangling pointers, and double frees.

In order do help you discover who you are, what you excel, and what do you really enjoy  doing. I will be briefly vague here to point some emotional support and reasoning to help you answer the question.  If you are clear about that, please skip this entire section. Here goes a small amount of advices I wish I have  heard when I was young.</p> <p> </p> Ikigai Note <p>The above image links to a very good reference to understand the drives that you should be aware while taking decisions on your future career. Visit it.</p> <p>You are a complex being and hard to define. I know. It is hard to put yourself in a frame or box, but this process is  relevant to make the life of the others to evaluate if they want more you or not. If for some reason a person is  reading your portfolio, it means that you are ahead of the others, so you must respect their time and goals while  they are reading your content.</p> <p>What you do, do not define what you are, you can even work with something you dont love as long it is part of a bigger  plan. Given that, you have to know how to differentiate yourself from your work while respecting your  feelings. The sweet spot is when you mix who you are with what you do, and you have nice feelings about it. But this  can be hard to achieve and require maturity to mix things. If you dont have a clear understand of those aspects of  yourself, you will be subjected to be exploited by bad companies and managers.</p> <p>It is totally fine try to excel some job you are not passionate. You just have to find means to make your time  doing it as enjoyable as possible. In the end of the journey it will slowly become something you can be proud of,  and you will become a different person than the one you are now. Understanding this kind of mentality will help you  endure more and be more resilient to problems. </p> <p>Keep track of your progress towards your goal. First of all, have a clear goal, so you can build a path to it.  Otherwise, any path would sound just like any other apathetic path. Having a clear goal will make your path  shine and easy to choose. It will help you in difficult moments where you feel uncomfortable by being just a small  piece of a machinery. You will be able to act as part of machine while you need to achieve your goal as a necessary  step.</p> <p>Focus on always keep track on your evolution on your journey to excellence. Don't compare too much yourself to the  others, everyone is facing a different journey and everyone took different paths in their career that probably you  didn't have the option to chose in the past. But you cannot be uncritical either, you have to analyse your progress and  check if your current path is making you life good, you have to take a decision to change the plan or even the goal  with the new information you learned through the current path you are pursuing.</p> <p>In other point of view, you wont start your career as senior developer, so you have to build your own path. Making  mistakes is part of the process, and that is the reason you will be gradually exposed to big things. You should  accept yourself, don't push too hard, and do some basic stuff. Just accept the challenges of doing something not  fancy, but relevant to build your career.</p>"},{"location":"portfolio/01-introduction/#define-and-state-your-mission-and-goal","title":"Define and state your mission and goal","text":"<ul> <li>Are you a generalist or a specialist type?</li> <li>What position you are looking for?</li> <li>What kind of person you want to become?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"portfolio/01-introduction/#gather-information","title":"Gather information","text":"<p>In order to build a good portfolio, you will need to gather information about yourself and your work.

When you type a domain name into your web browser, such as \"www.example.com,\" your computer sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address, such as \"192.0.2.1.\" The IP address is then used to establish a connection with the web server that hosts the website you are trying to access.</p> <p>DNS plays a crucial role in hosting because it enables users to access websites using domain names instead of IP addresses. This makes it easier for users to remember and find websites. DNS also allows websites to change servers or IP addresses without affecting the user experience, as long as the DNS records are updated properly.</p> <p>In hosting, DNS is important because it determines which server is responsible for hosting a particular website. DNS records can be configured to point to different servers depending on factors such as geographic location, server load, and failover.
